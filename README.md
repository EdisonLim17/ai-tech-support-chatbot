# AI Tech Support Chatbot

AI Tech Support Chatbot is a cloud-native, enterprise-grade serverless application that delivers instant technical support responses to users. Built on Amazon Bedrock with the Claude 3.5 Haiku model, it intelligently answers questions, redacts sensitive information, validates JSON outputs, and escalates unresolved issues to human agents—all while enforcing company policies, tone guidelines, and strict business rules.

The architecture prioritizes high availability, scalability, and security, capable of handling millions of concurrent connections with 99.95 % uptime and fast response times. Infrastructure is fully automated with Terraform and GitHub Actions, requiring zero manual configuration.

**Key AWS Components:**
- **API Gateway** – Public HTTPS endpoint for chatbot requests
- **AWS Lambda** – Stateless compute layer running the chatbot logic and Bedrock calls
- **Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Haiku)** – Large language model powering intelligent responses
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – Stores conversation history and escalation data with millisecond latency
- **Amazon SNS** – Publishes escalation notifications to human support channels
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Monitors metrics, logs, and alerts for uptime and performance
- **AWS Secrets Manager** – Secures API keys, system prompt templates, and configuration
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure-as-code for reproducible, environment-agnostic deployments
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipelines for automated provisioning, testing, and deployments

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

### Infrastructure – Terraform + GitHub Actions
- On pushes to `main`, GitHub Actions runs Terraform plans and applies infrastructure updates automatically
- Secrets and configuration values are fetched dynamically from Secrets Manager and Terraform outputs

### Application Code – GitHub Actions
- Backend Lambda code is tested and deployed without manual steps
- Automated rollback on failed builds ensures continuous availability
